# networks.txt:
#
# This identifies known networks and provides the IPs for their IFS gateway servers.
#
# Each line in this file is of the format
# <inter-network number>  <IFS host IP or hostname[:port]>
#
# for example:
#   5#    132.22.110.96
# would define network 5's gateway as 132.22.110.96 with the default port of 42425.
#
#   12#   myhostname.net:6666
# defines network 12's gateway at myhostname.net, port 6666.
#

#
# There must be an entry present for our local network, or else routing will be disabled.
